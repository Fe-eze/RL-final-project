My final year individual project: Using Reinforcement learning to control simulations

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that uses inputs from
the environment to determine the next optimal steps to take in order to solve the
task given. This preliminary report starts out with the theoretical/statistical
basis of reinforcement learning techniques on a popular problem ’The One armed
bandit’. After these techniques are explored, experiments are performed to
compare their performance on a simulated bandit. Finally, Gym is loaded with
a game called ’Cartpole’ in which we try to balance a pole on a cart. A random
search algorithm is used to solve the environment.
